**Privacy Policy for Chrome Extension**

Our Chrome extension is designed to scrape website content and financial data for the purpose of comparison and transmission to user-specified APIs, while emphasizing user privacy and data ownership. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle user data within the extension:

**1. Data Collection**

- The extension collects website content and financial data to compare it with data surfaced via user-specified APIs.
- We scrape website content and financial data for the purpose of pushing it to user-specified APIs.
- The extension stores public keys locally in Chrome local storage in plain text for secure communication with user-specified APIs.

**2. User Control and Ownership**

- Users have full control over the destination of their data and can specify their own API endpoints within the extension settings.
- Users are responsible for the privacy and security of the APIs they choose to communicate with.
- We do not have access to, or control over, the data transmitted to user-specified APIs.

**3. Data Security**

- While data transmissions use HTTPS for secure communication, the data is not otherwise encrypted during storage or transmission.
- Public keys are stored in Chrome local storage in plain text.
- Users are encouraged to ensure the security of their API endpoints and use secure communication protocols.

**4. Changes to Privacy Policy**

- Any updates to this Privacy Policy will be communicated to users within the extension interface.

**5. Contact Information**

- If you have questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy or extension practices, please contact [Brad Johnson via GitHub](https://github.com/bradk88).
